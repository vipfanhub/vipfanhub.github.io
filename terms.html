Influencer set their own pricing. It is your responsibility to check the price before subscribing or making a purchase.

The Company does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.

The Company accepts payment via the payment method indicated before the purchase. You must have a valid accepted form of payment on file to purchase a subscription. You must abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal agreement, whether with the Company or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment method. The Company will charge your credit card or other form of payment for the price listed for the relevant subscription, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees, and currency fluctuations. </li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Recurring Billing.</span> <span class="red_text">If you purchase any automatically renewing subscriptions, you hereby authorize the Company or its payment processor to charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the relevant subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other similar reason and the Company is unable to charge you on the next billing period, the Company may immediately revoke your access to any subscription you have purchased until you update your payment method. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time, the Company may cancel your subscription.</span></li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Taxes.</span> If the Company is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a subscription (for example, the Company collects VAT taxes from EU users), those taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction. Additionally, if required by law, you are responsible for reporting and paying certain taxes in connection with your purchase and use of a subscription. These taxes may include duties, customs fees, or other taxes (other than income tax), along with any related penalties or interest, as applicable to your purchase or country of purchase. </li>
                                
                                <li><span class="bold">Refunds.</span> All sales and transactions are final. <span class="red_text">Payments are nonrefundable and fully earned on payment. There are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.</span> But the Company may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist, including if an influencer fails to add you to their private third-party social media account within 24 hours after you buy a subscription to that influencer’s private third-party social media account (unless the failure to add was caused by your failure to provide accurate information). The amount and form of a refund, and the decision to provide it, is at the Company’s sole discretion. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate the Company to provide refunds in the future, under any circumstance. </li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Subscription Cancellations.</span> If you buy a subscription that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period and the cancellation will take effect on the next billing period. You retain access to the subscription from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period and will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period. <span class="red_text">To cancel a subscription, please contact the payment processor that you paid through.</span></li>
